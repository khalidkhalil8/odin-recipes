    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>Lasagna is a comforting Italian classic made by layering tender sheets of pasta with a rich, savory meat sauce, creamy ricotta cheese, and a generous amount of melted mozzarella. The sauce, often made with ground beef or sausage, is simmered with onions, garlic, and tomatoes for deep flavor, while the ricotta is mixed with egg and herbs for extra creaminess. Each layer is built carefully, creating a beautiful cross-section of pasta, sauce, and cheese that bakes together into a bubbling, golden masterpiece. Perfect for family dinners or gatherings, lasagna is as impressive to serve as it is satisfying to eat.</p>
