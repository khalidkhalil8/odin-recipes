    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>Mac and cheese is a warm, cheesy comfort food made by combining tender pasta with a rich, creamy cheese sauce. The sauce is prepared by melting cheddar into a smooth milk-and-butter base, creating a perfect coating for every bite. For extra flavor and texture, it can be baked until golden with a crispy breadcrumb topping. Whether served as a quick stovetop dish or baked for a special occasion, mac and cheese is a simple yet satisfying meal loved by all ages.</p>
